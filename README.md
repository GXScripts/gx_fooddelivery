# gx_fooddelivery
A FiveM Script for QB-Core or ESX that gives Civilians an Uber Eats like job where they deliver food to civilians

This script works with the following inventories: qb, ox, codem, qs
It also works with Many Notification systems, However if yours isnt already in the script you can add it in client/functions.lua 

The only dependency is ox_lib 

This is my first script so there may be issues but it works fine in my servers, if you find any issues you can open a ticket at https://discord.gg/FfeCfkdXzd
